# insta_findr
app that takes a hashtag, start date, and end date, and collects submissions from Instagram

*THE PLAN*

The goal is to build a very lightweight but robust application that allows a user to input a hashtag and get content from Instagram.

*STACK*
**Foundation CSS**
Foundation will allow me to have a clean and simple design that can be easily customized later
**Vanilla JS + JQuery**
Since I want something really lightweight I'm choosing not to add any front end frameworks. I'll focus on making the app robust on the back end and use basic JS/JQuery for any interaction
**Ruby on Rails app**
Rails will help me get started pretty fast and does a lot for free - and I'm all about free help
**PostgreSQL Database**
Postgres will be handled really nicely in Heroku and is pretty versatile
**Heroku server**
Easy deployment and allows for free dev server
